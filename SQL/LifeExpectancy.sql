-- LIFE EXPECTANCY DATA ANALYSIS: COMPLETE POSTGRESQL WORKFLOW
-- =====================================================
-- Project: Global Life Expectancy Analysis (2000-2015)
-- Author: Lloyd Dela Cruz
-- Date: Dec 2024
-- Database: PostgreSQL
-- Tool: PostgreSQL extension; Claude AI; ChatGPT; Perplexity AI 
-- 
-- PROJECT STRUCTURE:
-- 1. Database Setup and Data Loading
-- 2. Initial Data Exploration
-- 3. Data Quality Assessment
-- 4. Data Cleaning and Standardization
-- 5. External Data Integration and Validation
-- 6. Feature Engineering
-- 7. Analytical Insights
-- 8. Final Dashboard Data Preparation
--
-- WHY THIS ANALYSIS MATTERS:
-- Life expectancy is the most fundamental measure of population health.
-- This analysis identifies successful health policies, efficient healthcare
-- systems, and critical factors that can guide interventions to save lives.
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- SECTION 1: DATABASE SETUP AND DATA LOADING
-- =====================================================
-- Purpose: Create database structure and load raw data
-- Note: Adjust file path based on your local setup

-- 1.1 Create Database (Run in psql or pgAdmin)
-- CREATE DATABASE life_expectancy_analysis;
-- \c life_expectancy_analysis;

-- 1.2 Create Schema for Organization
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS raw_data;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS cleaned_data;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS external_data;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS analytics;

-- 1.3 Create Raw Data Table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS raw_data.life_expectancy CASCADE;
CREATE TABLE raw_data.life_expectancy (
    country VARCHAR(255),
    year INTEGER,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    life_expectancy NUMERIC(5,2),
    adult_mortality NUMERIC(8,2),
    infant_deaths INTEGER,
    alcohol NUMERIC(5,2),
    percentage_expenditure NUMERIC(10,2),
    hepatitis_b NUMERIC(5,2),
    measles INTEGER,
    bmi NUMERIC(5,2),
    under_five_deaths INTEGER,
    polio NUMERIC(5,2),
    total_expenditure NUMERIC(5,2),
    diphtheria NUMERIC(5,2),
    hiv_aids NUMERIC(5,2),
    gdp NUMERIC(15,2),
    population BIGINT,
    thinness_1_19_years NUMERIC(5,2),
    thinness_5_9_years NUMERIC(5,2),
    income_composition_of_resources NUMERIC(5,3),
    schooling NUMERIC(4,1)
);

-- 1.4 Load Data from CSV
-- Note: Update the file path to match your local setup
-- For Mac: '/Users/Lloyd/Documents/Life_Expectancy_Data.csv'

-- COPY raw_data.life_expectancy
-- FROM '/path/to/your/Life_Expectancy_Data.csv'
-- WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', NULL '');

-- Alternative: If using VS Code PostgreSQL extension, you can use PSQL import wizard

-- 1.5 Verify Data Load
SELECT 
    'Total Records' as metric,
    COUNT(*) as value
FROM raw_data.life_expectancy
UNION ALL

-- =====================================================
-- SECTION 2: INITIAL DATA EXPLORATION
-- =====================================================
-- Purpose: Understand dataset structure and identify immediate issues
-- This helps us plan our cleaning strategy

-- 2.1 Sample Data Inspection
SELECT *

-- 2.2 Data Type Verification
SELECT

    MAX(year) as latest_year,
    COUNT(DISTINCT year) as total_years,
    string_agg(DISTINCT year::text, ', ' ORDER BY year::text) as all_years
FROM raw_data.life_expectancy;

-- 2.4 Country Count by Year
-- Why: Identifies if certain years have missing countries
SELECT 
    year,
    COUNT(DISTINCT country) as country_count,
    193 - COUNT(DISTINCT country) as missing_countries
FROM raw_data.life_expectancy
GROUP BY year

-- 2.5 Development Status Distribution
SELECT

    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage

GROUP BY status;

-- =====================================================

-- 
-- This comprehensive analysis provides:
-- 1. Clean, validated dataset with quality scores
-- 2. Multiple analytical perspectives on global health
-- 3. Identification of best practices and areas needing attention
-- 4. Ready-to-use data for visualization platforms
-- 5. Actionable insights for policy makers
--
-- Next Steps:
-- 1. Connect to visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI, etc.)
-- 2. Implement real-time data updates from WHO/World Bank APIs
-- 3. Extend analysis to include more recent years
-- 4. Add predictive modeling capabilities
-- 5. Create automated reporting workflows
