## üìä Project Overview

A comprehensive data analysis project examining global life expectancy trends across 193 countries from 2000-2015. This project provides actionable insights into health outcomes, policy effectiveness, and socioeconomic factors that influence population health worldwide.

### üéØ Key Objectives

- **Analyze Global Health Trends**: Identify patterns in life expectancy improvements across developed and developing nations
- **Healthcare Efficiency Assessment**: Evaluate which countries achieve optimal health outcomes with available resources
- **Policy Impact Analysis**: Examine the effectiveness of immunization programs, healthcare spending, and social determinants
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Provide evidence-based insights for health policy decision-making

## üöÄ Key Findings

### Global Progress
- **Global life expectancy increased by 4.2 years** from 2000-2015
- **Development gap**: 12.8 years between developed and developing countries (2015)
- **22 countries** gained more than 10 years in life expectancy during this period

### Healthcare Efficiency Champions
| Country | Life Expectancy | Health Spending (% GDP) | Efficiency Score |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| South Korea | 82.3 years | 7.2% | 11.4 |
| Japan | 83.7 years | 10.9% | 7.7 |
| Singapore | 82.1 years | 4.9% | 16.8 |

### Critical Findings
- **15 countries** face severe HIV burden (>10 deaths per 1000 births)
- **34 countries** have immunization coverage below 80%
- **Strong correlation** between education, income composition, and life expectancy (r > 0.8)

## üîß Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL 12+ 
- Database administration tool (pgAdmin, DBeaver, or VS Code PostgreSQL extension)

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lloyd-delacruz/LifeExpectancy.git
   cd LifeExpectancy
   ```

2. **Create PostgreSQL database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE life_expectancy_analysis;
   \c life_expectancy_analysis;
   ```

3. **Run the analysis**
   ```bash
   psql -d life_expectancy_analysis -f SQL/LifeExpectancy.sql
   ```

4. **Load the dataset**
   - Update the file path in the SQL script (line 74)
   - Execute the COPY command or use your database tool's import wizard
